# Introduction

The `wCVCalculator` package provides a function to calculate the Within-Subject Coefficient of Variation (wCV). This metric is useful in analyzing repeated measures data to quantify variability within subjects.

# Installation

To install the package, you can use the following command:

```r
devtools::install_github("yourusername/wCVCalculator")
```

# Function Overview

The main function in this package is `calculate_wCV()`. This function computes the wCV from two numeric vectors of measurements.

Here’s a quick overview of its usage:

```r
library(wCVCalculator)

# Example data
measurement1 <- c(100, 102, 98, 101, 99)
measurement2 <- c(101, 103, 97, 100, 98)

# Calculate wCV
result <- calculate_wCV(measurement1, measurement2)
```

# Output Explanation

The `calculate_wCV` function returns a list containing the following elements:

- **WithinSubjectVariance**: The variance within subjects.
- **WithinSubjectSD**: The standard deviation within subjects.
- **OverallMean**: The overall mean of the measurements.
- **wCV**: The Within-Subject Coefficient of Variation (as a percentage).
- **Data**: A data frame with intermediate calculations, such as differences and squared differences.

# Example Usage

Here’s a detailed example:

```r
# Define measurements
measurement1 <- c(100, 102, 98, 101, 99)
measurement2 <- c(101, 103, 97, 100, 98)

# Compute the wCV
result <- calculate_wCV(measurement1, measurement2)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

# Conclusion

The `wCVCalculator` package provides a simple and effective way to calculate the Within-Subject Coefficient of Variation, along with detailed intermediate statistics for further analysis.
